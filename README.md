# 7Driver

I had received an early birthday present and got an Arduno Uno kit from a family member. Since being an electronics hobbyist for over 15 years, the next day I decided to create a 7 segment LED driver using the components of the kit as well as others I had accrued over the years (some TTL chips, 74XX90/74XX47/74XX595/74XX155).

I plan on posting the schematic at some point.
